                <p class="hobby_body">I wasn't very interested in school. But at some point I realised that I wanted to make something new, come up with something good.</p>
                <p class="hobby_body">I love coming up with math and physics theories. My journey is to get there. Become a scientist or do as one.

                <h2 class="hobby_title">Addicted to coding apps/games</h2>
                <p class="hobby_body">I didn't have a great computer for most of my life, so I had to find stuff to do with what I had. I couldn't play almost any games so I found coding. My first programming language was HTML.</p>
                <p class="hobby_body">I learned a lot of programming languages on the way: <br> HTML,CSS -> C++ -> Python -> C -> Golang -> and in the present C!</p>
                <p class="hobby_body">The main reason I love programming is that I feel the same way as gaming, I have control and anything that happends is due to my actions, thus I'm able to do anything I'd wish with enough time!</p>

                <p class="hobby_body">Since I was a little child I got the oportunity to play videogames. It broadened my view on everything. Helped me a ton to learn english and it expanded my imagination!</p>
                <p class="hobby_body">Games are a great piece of media and entertainment but they shouldn't drain your entire day.</p>
